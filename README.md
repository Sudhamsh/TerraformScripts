# TerraformScripts

Goal is to capture terraformscripts sample scripts for learning. Terraform is an awesome way to implement IaaC. 
I have seen considerable number of problems in my 7+ years expeience in SRE Infrastructure space. Most of these problems were
a results of manual efforts, no repeatable steps, tribal knowledge in some one's head, etc. Most of these problems can be solved 
if you consider your infrastructes as code. 

Terraform allows Cloud regions and Availability Zones to be built with code, which is a great value to represent your data centers.


## Getting Started

Follow Terraform install scripts using https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html

### Prerequisites

Terraform CLI is installed
AWS account



### Installing

AWS credentials are set in ~/.aws/credentials file. Create an account if you don't one using https://aws.amazon.com/. You can destory your terrform created objects in a single command to avoid on-going costs.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system



### And coding style tests

Follow terraform coding format

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
